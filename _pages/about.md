<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. student in Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST), under the supervision of Prof. [Haofeng Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BRFfdhcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 

My research interest includes few-shot medical image segmentation and computer vision.
